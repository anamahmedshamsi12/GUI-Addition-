/**
 * Utility class that provides sorting strategies for streams of BoardGame objects.
 *
 * <p>I separated sorting into its own class so that Planner.java stays focused on
 * filtering logic. The sort strategy pattern is implemented here -- one entry-point
 * method (sort) builds the right comparator based on which column and direction are
 * requested, then applies it to the stream.
 *
 * <p>Tie-breaking: when two games have the same value on the chosen column, a secondary
 * sort by name (ascending, case-insensitive) is always applied to guarantee a
 * deterministic, consistent order.
